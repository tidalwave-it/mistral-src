Mistral
================================

This library is a fa√ßade for image manipulation, acting as a proxy to libraries such as Java2D, JAI, ImageJ.

In its early years (after 2003) it was used for photo development, metadata management and even demonstrated distributed
calculus on the Sun Grid.

At the end of 2016 development stopped. It resumed at the end of 2022, dropping obsolete stuff (JAI). At the moment the
portions related to image manipulation are not tested. Features about metadata manipulation are being actively developed.

A few scripts for U*ix and Windows systems are provided to quickly run examples:

+ runViewerExample.sh
+ runHistogramViewerExample.sh
+ runViewerExample.bat
+ runHistogramViewerExample.bat
