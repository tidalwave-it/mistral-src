It is possible to sign the generated jar files. Follow these instructions:

1. Decide where you want to keep the keystore (e.g. "/the/path/to/your/keystore") and choose a password for it (e.g. "yourpassword"). 
2. Create a file named "keystore.properties" in this directory, with the contents:

	keystore: /the/path/to/your/keystore
	password: yourpassword

3. Generate a certificate named "FaxManager" with the keytool (it's installed with the JDK). For instance:

	keytool -genkey -alias FaxManager -keyalg RSA -keystore /the/path/to/your/keystore -storepass yourpassword

   Fill the requested information and when keytool asks for the certificate password, just press return to use the same password as the keystore.

4. Run "ant sign".
5. The project will be built and jar files under "dist" will be signed.
